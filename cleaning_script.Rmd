# Some notes to start 

The .xls of the KOBO version of the harmonised tool needs to be downloaded and processed. This is in order to set the "empty container" with which we will match the rest of the datasets that we are cleaning. And go through each of the columns to decide on where and how exactly each partner had been compliant with the tool. Admittedly, I should have started here, but I still don't have access to the back-end of the KOBO survey. Ideally, I would just rename each of the columns in line with the question code in the harmonised tool, so I realised that I wasted a lot of time doing renaming below, though it does make navigating the dataset a little bit easier. 

For reference [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JHD1RaSEVRcrJHQ5y_KSzIq8T7OyglkH/edit#gid=243288867) to questionnaire.

## Empty dataset

We will use bind_rows with this empty dataset. I still haven't tested it, so I'm not entirely sure.

But to do some checks, I'd probably extract the column names as a list, then using select(contains()) or select(matches()) just to make sure that I haven't gotten anything too wrong. 

```{r}
cols <- codebook %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = question,
              values_from = class)  

cols <- cols[-c(2:205), -1] %>% 
  mutate(organisation_name = 
           recode(organisation_name, 
                  "character" = NA_character_))


```


# Datasets

Compliance with the harmonised tool is quite mixed, as even if there is full compliance with the questions, there is not always alignment in the options available. Additional cleaning is necessary in order to process and align it with the harmonised tool.

Longer-term, there is room for improvement in the harmonised tool: several alternative questions that partners have proposed performed better than the options we currently have. For instance, if household size is collected as a number, it should remain a number, as opposed to the "Yes/No" for the question option "We have a large household". Additionally, the AAP section in the harmonised tool seems primarily concerned with PSEA -- GOAL takes a much broader approach to monitoring AAP.

Shafak-CARE's demographic questions don't exactly match the harmonised too; they are all "Yes/No", probably fine to store them like that, in preparation for the rbind(): 

female_headed_household 
child_headed_household  
families_without_a_head_of_household 
injured_disabled_headed_households 
households_with_at_least_one_elderly_chronically_ill_or_disabled_person 
households_living_in_collective_shelter_abandoned_building_or_equivalent_poor_living_conditions
households_that_have_not_receved_assistance_in_the_past_two_months_from_relatives_or_other_actors 
households_with_multiple_children_under_5_years_total_family_more_than_7

In GOAL and Shafak-CARE, the community tensions question is separate from the question on disagreements. Both these questions are combined in Q5.10 in the harmonised tool. 

Shafak-CARE also doesn't ask about what the transfer value of the cash disbursed was.

cash_please_explain_the_problems_you_faced_with_the_money_trader

This is actually a very good question

GOAL outperforms on Q2.2, they ask for the actual breakdowns on item categories i.e. how much did your household spend on xx? As opposed to "Which are the top three items that your household spent the most money on?".
